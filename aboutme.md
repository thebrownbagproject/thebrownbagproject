subtitle: What is "The Brown Bag Project"
---

The Brown Bag Project aims to cultivate an inclusive environment of individuals from all walks of life who promote critical service learning alongside mindfulness in the form of Seva.

Seva, originating from Sanskrit, refers to “selfless service”, which in this case involves addressing the social injustices being witnessed within Worcester, MA in the form of shelter and food insecurity.


### Seva is a form of practicing mindfulness.

Our organization plans to address these issues through insightful dialogues in the hopes of dismantling the negative implicit biases we form towards the underserved within our community. ​

Additionally, through the creation of nutritiously conscious brown bag lunches, alongside providing resources such as hygiene care products and information on further resources and shelter security located in the Worcester County;

The Brown Bag Projects aims to aid people who are directly being affected by the lack of these vital social determinants of health in and around the Public Inebriate Program Shelter on 25 Queen Street, Worcester, MA

​
Partnering up with the Shri Radha Krishna Mandir of Northborough, The Brown Bag Project strives to use Seva Sessions to both raise awareness of the factors leading to the prevalence of these public health issues within our community through conversation and action while also dispelling any stigmatization that often is perpetuated through media and stereotypes.

### We can’t help everyone, but everyone can help someone.

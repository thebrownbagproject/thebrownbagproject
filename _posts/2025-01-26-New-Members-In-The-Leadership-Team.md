The Brown Bag Project recently onboarded Aarya Venkat and Sahil Malhotra onto the leadership team. They will be in charge of Operations and Finance, respectively. We're excited to go into the new year with plans to get 501c3 certified, grant funding, more fundraising, and more brown bags given to the Worcester community!

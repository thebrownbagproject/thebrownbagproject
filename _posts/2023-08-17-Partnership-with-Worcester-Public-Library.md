The Brown Bag Project has recently partnered up with the Worcester Public Library (WPL) in order to supply patrons facing hygiene insecurity while dealing with homelessness, access to supplies that are not easily available!

Libraries offer vital support to individuals experiencing homelessness by providing a safe and welcoming environment, access to resources like books, internet, and educational programs, aiding in skill development, and fostering a sense of belonging within the community.

They serve as hubs for knowledge and assistance, assisting in the journey towards stability and improved quality of life for those facing housing challenges.

TBBP is excited to be able to better serve their community through this partnership!
